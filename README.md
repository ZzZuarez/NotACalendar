<b>NotACalendar</b>


Welcome to NotACalendar, a web application designed to help you manage your time in an engaging and interactive way. This project offers a variety of features, such as daily and monthly organizers, a menstrual calendar, and even mini-games to make time management fun.


<b>Features</b>


Daily and Monthly Organizers: Keep track of your tasks and appointments in an easy-to-use calendar format.

Interactive Mini-Games: Take a break and play while still staying on top of your schedule.

Special Date Animation: A fun Easter egg-like feature where clicking the date changes it as if you're peeling off the days from a physical calendar.

Clean and Modern UI: Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, featuring a soft color palette and smooth animations.


<b>Technologies</b>


HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and styling.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Handles dynamic interactions, such as the calendar's animations and date management.

Turn.js: For flip-page animations.

Google Fonts: Custom fonts for a modern look.

jQuery: To simplify DOM manipulation and add interactivity.


<b>Future Improvements</b>


This is my first project in programming, and I plan to enhance it over time with additional technologies such as React.js, Node.js, or even back-end integrations for saving user data. Stay tuned for updates!
